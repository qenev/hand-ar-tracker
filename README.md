## Overview

Hand AR Tracker captures your webcam feed and overlays real-time augmented reality effects driven entirely by **hand gestures**, **spacebar presses**, and **eye winks** no buttons, no keyboard, just your body (plus the spacebar for toggling invert mode).

The core effect is a **holographic ASCII ribbon** that stretches between your two hands, rendering your silhouette as scrolling ASCII scanlines against a black background. Pressing **spacebar** inverts the entire effect, and a **double wink** locks the ribbon's position in 3D space.

---

## Features

- **Dual-hand tracking** - up to two hands simultaneously via MediaPipe Hands
- **Holographic ASCII ribbon** - scanline particle effect renders your silhouette as ASCII art between both hands
- **Space-to-reverse** - press the spacebar to flip the effect: real video inside ribbon, ASCII art outside
- **Double-wink lock** - wink twice in one second to freeze the ribbon position in space
- **Person + object segmentation** - MediaPipe Selfie Segmentation + background subtraction
- **Live FPS counter** with rolling average
- **Click-to-flip** camera rotation button in the HUD
- Auto GPU/CPU selection (CUDA or CPU)
- Fully configurable via `config.yaml`

## Installation

### Windows (one-click)

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qenev/hand-ar-tracker.git
   cd hand-ar-tracker
   ```

2. **Run the installer** - creates the virtual environment and installs all dependencies:
   ```
   install.bat
   ```

3. **Launch the tracker:**
   ```
   start.bat
   ```

### Manual installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qenev/hand-ar-tracker.git
cd hand-ar-tracker

python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
start.bat        # Windows one-click launch
# or
python main.py   # manual
```

The app opens your webcam. Show **both hands** to the camera to start.

## Tutorial: Step‑by‑step Walkthrough

1. **Launch** – run `start.bat` (Windows) or `python main.py`.
2. **Calibration** – the system automatically detects your hands and face. Wait a couple of seconds for the FPS counter to stabilize.
3. **Enable the ribbon** – perform a **double‑pinch** (thumb and index together on each hand, then touch the pinched tips). The holographic ASCII ribbon appears between your hands.
4. **Reverse mode** – press **spacebar**. The ribbon now shows the *real* video inside while the rest of the scene turns ASCII.
5. **Lock the ribbon** – wink one eye twice within one second. The ribbon’s position freezes in space, allowing you to move your hands without moving the effect.
6. **Unlock** – repeat the double‑wink to release the lock.
7. **Toggle off** – repeat the double‑pinch gesture to turn the ribbon off.
8. **Adjust settings** – edit `config.yaml` to change camera resolution, confidence thresholds, colors, or to enable extra gesture labels.
9. **Exit** – press **Q** or **ESC** (hand‑skeleton toggle) to close the application.

## Controls Summary

| Control | Action |
|---|---|
| **Double‑pinch touch** | Toggle ASCII ribbon ON/OFF |
| **Spacebar** | Switch to reverse mode (real video inside ribbon, ASCII outside) |
| **Double wink** (one eye) | Lock / unlock ribbon position |
| **Q** | Quit application |
| **ESC** | Toggle hand skeleton visibility |
| **Delete** | Show/hide HUD (FPS, flip button, device label) |

---

---

## Gesture Controls

Most effects are controlled entirely by **body gestures** - no keyboard required for tracking or locking the AR effects.

### Double Pinch Touch - Toggle Ribbon ON/OFF

Bring both hands in front of the camera, **pinch** your thumb and index finger together on **each hand simultaneously**, then touch the two pinched fingertips together.

- **First double-pinch:** Ribbon turns **ON** (ASCII scanline effect between hands)
- **Second double-pinch:** Ribbon turns **OFF**
- If either hand leaves frame while the ribbon is off, the effect auto-resets

```
Both hands visible → pinch both → touch pinched tips together → toggle
```

### Double Wink - Lock / Unlock Ribbon Position

Wink **one eye** (not both - a full blink won't count) **twice within 1 second** to lock the ribbon at its current position in space. The ribbon will stay frozen even if you move your hands away.

- **Double-wink while ribbon is ON:** Position locks. You can lower your hands - the ribbon stays.
- **Double-wink while ribbon is locked:** Unlocks the ribbon so it follows your hands again.

## Keyboard Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Spacebar** | Switch to reverse mode (real video inside ribbon, ASCII outside) |
| **Q** | Quit the application |
| **ESC** | Toggle hand skeleton visibility (dots + lines) on/off |
| **Delete** | Toggle the entire HUD (FPS counter, flip button, device label) on/off |

### HUD - On-screen Controls

| Element | Location | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **FPS counter** | Top-left | Live rolling-average frame rate |
| **Flip 180 button** | Top-center (clickable) | Click to rotate camera 180° for upside-down mounts |
| **Device label** | Top-right | Shows `CUDA` or `CPU` |

## Effect Modes

### Default Mode (no reverse toggle)

```
Ribbon OFF:  Normal camera feed
Ribbon ON:   Your silhouette rendered as scrolling ASCII scanlines
             between your two hands, against a black background.
             Rest of frame is plain black.
```

### Reversed Mode (after spacebar press)

```
Ribbon OFF:  Full frame converted to ASCII art on black background
Ribbon ON:   Inside ribbon = clear real video
             Outside ribbon = ASCII art
             (No border - clean hard edge)
```

### Locked Ribbon (after double wink)

The ribbon polygon stays fixed in screen-space at the position captured when the wink fired. Works in both default and reversed modes.
